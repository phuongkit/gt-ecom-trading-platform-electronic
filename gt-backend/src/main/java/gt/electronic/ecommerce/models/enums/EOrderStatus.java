  // assigned a "Pending" status and can be found under the More tab in the View Orders screen.

  // confirmed. Authorize only transactions that are not yet captured have this status.

  // confirmed.

  // of the View Orders screen.
  //  Cancelled — Seller has cancelled an order, due to a stock inconsistency or other reasons.

  // paid for the order or the seller has marked the order as a fraudulent order.
  //  Manual Verification Required — Order on hold while some aspect, such as tax-exempt
  // documentation, is manually confirmed. Orders with this status must be updated manually.
